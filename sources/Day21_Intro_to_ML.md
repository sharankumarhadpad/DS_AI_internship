# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence,
It is built for building systems that learn patterns from data and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed for every rule.

## 1 Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the module is trained on a labelled dataset .

The model learns a mapping function from inputs to outputs by analyzing labeled examples. Once trained, it can predict outputs for new, unseen data.

Common Tasks:

- Classification
- Regression

Example: Predicting whether an email is spam or not.

## 2 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning is used when the dataset does not contain labeled outputs.

The model tries to discover hidden patterns, structures, or clusters within the data without being told the correct answers.

Common Tasks:

- Clustering
- Association rule mining
- Dimensionality reduction

Example: Grouping customers into segments based on behavior.

## 3 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a learning approach where an agent interacts with an environment and learns by receiving rewards or penalties.
The model improves its behavior over time by maximizing cumulative reward through trial and error.

Common Applications:

- Robotics
- Game playing AI
- Autonomous systems
